# Brzozowski Regular Expression Pattern Matcher

Welcome to the Brzozowski Regular Expression Pattern Matcher in Scala!

## Overview

This Scala project implements a regular expression pattern matcher based on the Brzozowski derivative. The implementation covers checking if the regular expression can match an empty string, calculating the derivative of a regular expression, simplifying regular expressions, and calculating the size of the regular expression tree.


## Features

1. **Empty String Matching:**
   - Checks if the given regular expression can match an empty string.

2. **Derivative Calculation:**
   - The derivative of a regular expression is calculated using the Brzozowski derivative.

3. **Simplification:**
   - Regular expressions can be simplified for more efficient matching.

4. **Size Calculation:**
   - The size of the regular expression tree is calculated.
